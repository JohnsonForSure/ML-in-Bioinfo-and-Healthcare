The text-to-Image project only includes one file "Text2Image.ipynb" <br>
It is designed to run on Colab, and there is no need for pre-downloaded models <br>
The code includes both the figures and .csv files stored in the 'data' folder. Please update the file paths in the code to match your own directory. <br>
All generated results are stored in the 'Results' folder. <br>
All the function or toolkit used can be derived by derectly excuting the code "! pip install ...", which have already be written inside the file. <br>
Note that, to run the text-to-Image models, there are two requirement: 
  1) Diffuser: Standard Difussion, CLIP, Kandinsky, and ControlNet
  2) MniDalle: Mini DallE
Model Installation can take you a lot of time, please be patient
